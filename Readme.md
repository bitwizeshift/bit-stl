# `bit::stl` Standard library

## Description

This is the standsard template library for various personal projects of mine. It is both an extension to the standard library, along with a custom implementation of future-proof components (such as c++17 features like std::string_view that is not available to a c++14 compiler).

All functions and types are written to replicate the standard namespace's naming conventions for easy use and upgradeability to new c++ library features at is released.

All definitions reside within `namespace bit`, short for `bitwize`/`bitwize_shift` (my common username).
